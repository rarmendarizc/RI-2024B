238691,Simple Macaroni and Cheese,"Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple recipe is cheap and tasty.",1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni; ¼ cup butter; ¼ cup all-purpose flour; ½ teaspoon salt; ground black pepper to taste; 2 cups milk; 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese,"This mac and cheese recipe uses staple ingredients and comes together in just 25 minutes. You'll want to bookmark this recipe for busy weeknights. The good news is, it's so simple that once you make it a couple times, you'll likely have it memorized. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes. While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn. Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated. This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe. To do so, complete the first three steps above, then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling. Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash of milk or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically. You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve, simply transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal. This is a great starter recipe that allows for endless customizations. Here are some add-in suggestions from Allrecipes reviewers: ""I added onion powder, Parmesan cheese and a little bit of cayenne pepper,"" says RRL. ""I always recommend using different cheeses for taste. I use white cheddar and four cheese Mexican blend together,"" says Angel. ""I like to add diced ham and peas or diced chicken and broccoli…"" says Fred Cannon. ""I added yellow mustard and topped with crushed Ritz crackers,"" says Memmere. ""This is a simple and creamy basic mac and cheese!"" says Allrecipes Allstar Christina. ""I used light Velveeta and 2 percent milk with great results. Very easy to put together, and a nice recipe to customize to your own tastes."" ""Amazing recipe and so creamy!"" raves foto5. ""For a simple macaroni and cheese recipe as the title suggests, this recipe was fabulous!"" says reviewer Karli F. ""I'm throwing out my box macaroni!"" Gather the ingredients.

6900,Homemade Dumplings,My mother was one of the best cooks I ever knew. Whenever she made stews we mostly found homemade dumplings in them. We never ate things from packages or microwaves and you sure could taste what food was. That's the only way I cook today — I don't use any electronic gadgets to cook with except an electric stove.,1 cup all-purpose flour; 2 teaspoons baking powder; 1 teaspoon white sugar; ½ teaspoon salt; 1 tablespoon butter or margarine; ½ cup milk,"Have a hankering for light, fluffy, tender dumplings just like your mom used to make? You've come to the right place. These homemade dumplings are easy to make with just six pantry staples – and they're even easier to eat. With this top-rated recipe, you'll make perfect dumplings every time. A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings. These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings. They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist. This recipe is made with just six ingredients you probably already have on hand. FlourThese dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together. Baking PowderBaking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture. White SugarA teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings. SaltA pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. Butter or MargarineCold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender. MilkWhole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough. To make sure a dumpling is done cooking, pierce it with a fork or toothpick. You'll know it's done when the fork or toothpick comes out clean. You can store leftover cooked dumplings or dumpling soup in an airtight container in the fridge for two to three days. Reheat gently on the stove or in 10-second intervals in the microwave. Some people like to freeze dumpling dough for quick and easy cooking. It couldn't be easier: Just drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet, flash freeze for at least three hours or up to overnight, then transfer the now-frozen dough to a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag. Label with the date and freeze for about three months. When it's time to use them, let the dumplings thaw for about 30 minutes and then drop them directly into the soup or stew. ""I have made the same old dumplings for years,"" says LIZ1888. ""I came upon this recipe and tried it. These were great! I made them for chicken and dumplings. They also thickened the sauce as they cooked."" ""The dumplings came out so light and fluffy and flavorful,"" according to ALISON K.

223042,Chicken Parmesan,"My version of chicken Parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.","4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves; salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste; 2 large eggs; 1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed; ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided; 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed; ½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed; ½ cup prepared tomato sauce; ¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes; ¼ cup chopped fresh basil; ½ cup grated provolone cheese; 2 teaspoons olive oil","Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home. In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method. Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan. Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down. Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan: Now find out the best wine to pair with your non-soggy, not-too-saucy baked chicken Parmesan. Enjoy! ""Perfectly delicious and beautiful just as instructed!"" says angie. ""As the video explains, too much sauce and/or cheese only takes away from the flavor — I learned this by experience. I suggest having additional sauce and/or cheese available if guests choose to add more on their plate, but personally think less is more in this case."" ""This recipe delivers!"" raves deneice knotts. ""This was SO easy. My chicken was juicy and crunchy plus the cheesy goodness. YUM!! My son said this 'slaps,' which means it's one of the best things he has ever tasted. Thanks! I'll make this again without being afraid of dry chicken."" ""A wonder of wonders!"" raves Joe. ""Watch the vid! Chef John has some cost-effective tips on flouring your chicken. As well as seasoning the chicken, instead of the flour, eggs, and panko. You will never do it any other way again. Two things I changed was to use my wife's spaghetti sauce. Of course. The other was to use Italian seasoning instead of fresh basil, which was not at hand. We WILL be making this again and again.""

262181,Cast Iron Pan-Seared Steak (Oven-Finished),"Steak is marinated in the fridge for 45 minutes, then quickly pan-seared in a cast iron skillet before it is finished in the oven.","2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks; 2 cups orange juice; 1 cup apple cider vinegar; ½ cup Worcestershire sauce; 1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand Uncle Chris'), or to taste; freshly ground black pepper to taste; 2 teaspoons olive oil; sea salt to taste","If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior. We love this oven-finished steak recipe for a lot of reasons. To name a few: The skillet is the star of the show. Why? Cast iron absorbs and retains heat like no other surface. It heats up fast and cooks evenly. A hot cast iron skillet puts a quick sear on steaks, creating a beautiful caramelized crust, without overcooking the center of the steak. Also, the cast iron skillet goes from stovetop to oven with ease. This recipe calls for beef top-sirloin steaks. Choose steaks that are at least 1-inch thick. If the steak is too thin, the inside will overcook before the beautiful caramelized crust can form on the outside. Of course, this stovetop-to-oven technique works well for more expensive cuts, too. Allrecipes community member Ken Turnbull loves the technique for thick steaks with nice marbling: ""I learned this method from a good steak house almost 50 years ago and always have the best results,"" he says. This simple steak recipe calls for marinating your top-sirloin steaks in a simple marinade made up of common ingredients you likely have on hand: Orange juice, cider vinegar, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce. The ideal steak marinades are simple mixtures of acid (OJ and cider), fat (olive oil), and seasonings (Worcestershire sauce). The acid tenderizes the meat and delivers a tangy flavor foundation; the fat binds the marinade and helps prevent steaks from sticking; and the seasonings, well, they add flavor. Let the steaks sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute. As your steaks rest, they will also continue to cook slightly. For best results, use a meat thermometer to test for doneness. Here is what you're aiming for: Rare: 125 degrees F (52 degrees C)Medium Rare: 130 degrees F (54 degrees C)Medium: 140 degrees F (60 degrees C)Medium Well: 150 degrees F (65 degrees C)Well Done: 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) ""The outside had a perfect crust and inside it was extremely juicy and tender,"" says Jeffrey Klotzbach. ""I would recommend it to anyone."" ""A 1-inch thick steak is as thin as you want to go,"" says Ken Turnbull. ""For medium rare, I find that between 1 and 2 minutes per side is all that is needed for the sear and that 5 minutes in a 425 degree oven is enough, if not too much, for a 1-inch steak."" ""I used a 1-pound petite sirloin and splashed a little Pinot Noir in the pan drippings while the steak was resting,"" says rennhr. ""Then I reduced the sauce and finished with unsalted butter. Will definitely make again."" Editorial contributions by Carl Hanson. Gather all ingredients. Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes. Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper. Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 ½ minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven. Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove steaks from oven; season with salt.

228823,Quick Beef Stir-Fry,Quick and easy beef stir-fry recipe. I make this on my busiest weeknights.,"2 tablespoons vegetable oil; 1 pound beef sirloin, cut into 2-inch strips; 1 ½ cups fresh broccoli florets; 1  red bell pepper, cut into matchsticks; 2  carrots, thinly sliced; 1  green onion, chopped; 1 teaspoon minced garlic; 2 tablespoons soy sauce; 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted","This classic beef stir-fry recipe is the perfect way to use up some of your leftover vegetables and other pantry staple ingredients. This beef and broccoli dish comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them! This stir fry is packed with strips of beef steak, veggies, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made. The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result. After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds. Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer. Learn more: How to Make the Easiest Stir-Fry Ever Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck. Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying. If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil. If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches. When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results. ""I added this recipe to my favorites list not even a month ago and I have made this, using different variations every time, at least 5 times. My family loves this recipe and I've paired it with rice or noodles and it always pleases. I usually use beef stew meat and switch up the vegetables. I would definitely recommend this recipe for anybody that's pressed for time and wants to make a quick easy meal that the whole family will enjoy,"" says Tiana Marie Ginorio. ""Hubby and I both liked this. It's very easy to make and is ready in no time. I used flank steak instead of sirloin and I didn't have any green onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. We both though it needed a bit of something, so after the first few bites we added some crushed chilis for a bit of heat,"" adds Allrecipes Allstar France C. ""Made it true to the recipe except that I only used half of a red bell pepper because it was what I had. The dish didn't suffer at all for it and the spiciness was just right for me. Served over rice and was the best quick meal that I made this week,"" raves Shoebox. Gather all ingredients.

Reviewers rave about the ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic glaze that is brushed onto the chops on the grill.

When the weather is nice, take your pork chops outside and throw them on the grill. Not only will they cook up quickly, but they'll also get the tasty grill marks that everyone loves.

They typically take about the same amount of time to cook, so it's really up to personal preference or what's on sale at the grocery store this week. You will want to pay attention to the thickness of the pork chop, though. Thicker pork chops will take longer to cook, but they won't dry out as easily as thinner pork chops can on the grill.

You can easily make a gourmet restaurant-worthy meal in the comfort of your own kitchen with this top-rated chicken cordon bleu recipe. It's impressive, delicious, and way simpler than you think. A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked. Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard. ""Cordon bleu"" translates to ""blue ribbon."" According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs. There are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper. Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick. Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted. This recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. However, every oven is different — the chicken should no longer be pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

We did enjoy the occasional box of mac and cheese, or package of pop-tarts, but virtually all dishes like this ground beef stroganoff noodles were made from scratch. Hamburger Helper was something other moms who didn't know how to cook served their kids, and while that might have been a touch hypocritical, since she may have been making pancakes from a box while saying it, we were grateful. Having said all that, I've had Hamburger Helper, and didn't hate it, and the idea of a quick, easy, one-pan meal involving meaty sauce coved noodles was a great one. So, I decided to share this homage. There are many different shapes and sizes of egg noodles, so the one and only challenge with this recipe is their cooking time.

Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.)

Boneless thighs are best for nights when time is of the essence — you'll still get the sweet, zesty flavor you want with a slightly shorter cook time. This bold oven-roasted chicken recipe works with just about anything. Try pairing garlic brown sugar chicken with a roasted vegetable side dish or earthy risotto to cut through the sweetness. A garlicky toast or tangy potato salad would also complement this dish well. Refrigerate leftover chicken in an airtight container to safely reheat and enjoy for up to four days.

The leftovers will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months.,1 cup all-purpose flour; ¾ cup packed brown sugar; ½ cup butter; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; ½ teaspoon salt; 2 tablespoons milk; ½ cup milk chocolate chips; ½ cup mini chocolate chips,"This edible cookie dough recipe is meant to be enjoyed by the spoonful. No baking required! Traditional cookie dough is unsafe to consume before it’s baked because of the presence of eggs and raw flour. This recipe doesn’t contain eggs at all, but it does contain all-purpose flour — that’s why it’s important to heat-treat the flour (cook it at a high temperature to kill the dangerous bacteria) before you incorporate it into the dough. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics: You likely already have most of the ingredients you’ll need for edible cookie dough on hand: Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this edible cookie dough recipe: Note: If you do not have a microwave, you can heat-treat the flour by spreading it on a baking sheet and toasting in an oven at 350 degrees F for 5 to 6 minutes. Store the edible cookie dough in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week or in the freezer for up to one month. “If you’re looking to eat this by yourself, you might want to split the recipe in two, because it makes a very large amount of cookie dough,” according to one Allrecipes community member. “Overall, it was super delicious and I would definitely eat it again!” “Delicious,” says another Allrecipes community member. “I followed the recipe exactly, but also added sprinkles.

So happy to have found this!” “Absolutely delicious,” raves another community member. “I mixed it with a few scoops of vanilla ice cream and made chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.” Editorial contributions by Corey Williams Gather all ingredients. To heat-treat your flour so it is safe to use: Place flour in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 1 minute and 15 seconds, stirring it every 15 seconds. Set aside. Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in vanilla extract and salt. Add heat-treated flour; mix until a crumbly dough forms. Stir in milk until dough is just combined; fold in milk chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips. Serve and enjoy! There is a potential risk of foodborne illness from the consumption of raw flour.

238691,Simple Macaroni and Cheese,"Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple recipe is cheap and tasty.",1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni; ¼ cup butter; ¼ cup all-purpose flour; ½ teaspoon salt; ground black pepper to taste; 2 cups milk; 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese,"This mac and cheese recipe uses staple ingredients and comes together in just 25 minutes. You'll want to bookmark this recipe for busy weeknights. The good news is, it's so simple that once you make it a couple times, you'll likely have it memorized. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes. While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn. Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated. This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe. To do so, complete the first three steps above, then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling. Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash of milk or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically. You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve, simply transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal. This is a great starter recipe that allows for endless customizations. Here are some add-in suggestions from Allrecipes reviewers: ""I added onion powder, Parmesan cheese and a little bit of cayenne pepper,"" says RRL. ""I always recommend using different cheeses for taste. I use white cheddar and four cheese Mexican blend together,"" says Angel. ""I like to add diced ham and peas or diced chicken and broccoli…"" says Fred Cannon. ""I added yellow mustard and topped with crushed Ritz crackers,"" says Memmere. ""This is a simple and creamy basic mac and cheese!"" says Allrecipes Allstar Christina. ""I used light Velveeta and 2 percent milk with great results.

""For a simple macaroni and cheese recipe as the title suggests, this recipe was fabulous!"" says reviewer Karli F. ""I'm throwing out my box macaroni!"" Gather the ingredients. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn. Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated. Serve hot and enjoy!",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238691/simple-macaroni-and-cheese/
6900,Homemade Dumplings,My mother was one of the best cooks I ever knew. Whenever she made stews we mostly found homemade dumplings in them. We never ate things from packages or microwaves and you sure could taste what food was. That's the only way I cook today — I don't use any electronic gadgets to cook with except an electric stove.,1 cup all-purpose flour; 2 teaspoons baking powder; 1 teaspoon white sugar; ½ teaspoon salt; 1 tablespoon butter or margarine; ½ cup milk,"Have a hankering for light, fluffy, tender dumplings just like your mom used to make? You've come to the right place. These homemade dumplings are easy to make with just six pantry staples – and they're even easier to eat. With this top-rated recipe, you'll make perfect dumplings every time. A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings. These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings. They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist. This recipe is made with just six ingredients you probably already have on hand. FlourThese dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together. Baking PowderBaking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture. White SugarA teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings. SaltA pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. Butter or MargarineCold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender. MilkWhole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough. To make sure a dumpling is done cooking, pierce it with a fork or toothpick. You'll know it's done when the fork or toothpick comes out clean. You can store leftover cooked dumplings or dumpling soup in an airtight container in the fridge for two to three days. Reheat gently on the stove or in 10-second intervals in the microwave. Some people like to freeze dumpling dough for quick and easy cooking. It couldn't be easier: Just drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet, flash freeze for at least three hours or up to overnight, then transfer the now-frozen dough to a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag. Label with the date and freeze for about three months. When it's time to use them, let the dumplings thaw for about 30 minutes and then drop them directly into the soup or stew. ""I have made the same old dumplings for years,"" says LIZ1888. ""I came upon this recipe and tried it. These were great! I made them for chicken and dumplings. They also thickened the sauce as they cooked."" ""The dumplings came out so light and fluffy and flavorful,"" according to ALISON K. ""I was searching for a dumpling recipe made from scratch instead of a mix and was so happy to find this one."" ""I topped a vegetable stew with these dumplings on a chilly autumn evening in Wisconsin,"" says Pam Westfall ""Oh yum! Truly delicious. The perfect comfort food!"" Gather the ingredients. Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes. Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. Serve.

228823,Quick Beef Stir-Fry,Quick and easy beef stir-fry recipe. I make this on my busiest weeknights.,"2 tablespoons vegetable oil; 1 pound beef sirloin, cut into 2-inch strips; 1 ½ cups fresh broccoli florets; 1  red bell pepper, cut into matchsticks; 2  carrots, thinly sliced; 1  green onion, chopped; 1 teaspoon minced garlic; 2 tablespoons soy sauce; 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted","This classic beef stir-fry recipe is the perfect way to use up some of your leftover vegetables and other pantry staple ingredients. This beef and broccoli dish comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them! This stir fry is packed with strips of beef steak, veggies, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made. The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result. After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds. Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer. Learn more: How to Make the Easiest Stir-Fry Ever Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck. Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying. If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil. If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches. When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results. ""I added this recipe to my favorites list not even a month ago and I have made this, using different variations every time, at least 5 times. My family loves this recipe and I've paired it with rice or noodles and it always pleases. I usually use beef stew meat and switch up the vegetables. I would definitely recommend this recipe for anybody that's pressed for time and wants to make a quick easy meal that the whole family will enjoy,"" says Tiana Marie Ginorio. ""Hubby and I both liked this. It's very easy to make and is ready in no time.

""Made it true to the recipe except that I only used half of a red bell pepper because it was what I had. The dish didn't suffer at all for it and the spiciness was just right for me.

257938,Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai),My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil. The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.,"⅓ cup chicken broth; 1 tablespoon oyster sauce; 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed; 2 teaspoons fish sauce; 1 teaspoon white sugar; 1 teaspoon brown sugar; 2 tablespoons vegetable oil; 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped; ¼ cup sliced shallots; 4 cloves garlic, minced; 2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper; 1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves; 2 cups hot cooked rice","Allrecipes home cooks give a solid 5-star rating to Chef John's easy-to-make version of Thai basil chicken (pad krapow gai), a popular Thai restaurant-worthy dish that's ready in less than 30 minutes. In his easy and accessible style, Chef John walks you through the recipe ingredients and shows you how to build layers of flavor using simple cooking techniques. ""I don't cook Thai food at home often, mostly because there are at least a dozen such restaurants within walking distance, but when I do, there's nothing I enjoy more than this spicy Thai basil chicken,"" says Chef John. Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food. SauceChicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe. ChickenChef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture. Shallots and garlicSliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor. Hot chile peppersThis is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat. BasilThis recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or ""holy"" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish. ""No, I didn't use the real ""holy"" basil,"" says Chef John. ""But even with regular basil, this simple recipe is spectacular. Aromatic basil is the perfect herb for pairing with the slightly sweet, sort of salty, and possibly spicy, chopped meat."" There are more than 100 varieties of basil, all of which are members of the mint family, and each variety has its own flavor. Thai basil has a mildly spicy licorice or anise seed flavor. Sweet basil (also known as Italian basil) tastes sweet and peppery. Holy basil (also called Thai holy basil) tastes of pepper and cloves. Read more: What's the Difference Between Thai Basil, Sweet Basil, and Holy Basil? Chef John recommends you prep all the ingredients before you start cooking because once you start the stir-fry, it all comes together very quickly. Prep takes about 15 minutes and cooking time is a speedy 10 minutes. If you want to serve the chicken with steamed rice, time your cooking accordingly. To get started, you'll add the oil and minced chicken to a smoking-hot skillet and cook the chicken briefly for a couple of minutes. Next, you'll add the shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies, and cook for another couple of minutes. About a tablespoon of the sauce goes in next to cook for a minute with the chicken until it starts to caramelize on the skillet. Finally, you add the rest of the sauce, scraping up the caramelization and coating the chicken for another minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil until it's wilted from the residual heat. Now your Thai Basil Chicken is ready to serve. ""Amazing taste and for sure cheaper than buying it in a Thai restaurant,"" says Allrecipes home cook Seora Juarez. ""As suggested, go to a local Asian market to get your basil. It's a more authentic taste, but I've tried it with regular basil and it tastes good too. I like mine hot so I finely chop the peppers to make it spicy."" ""Amazing rendition of the classic Thai dish. I tend to use extra garlic and shallots. I use serrano chilies because traditional Thai chilies involve an extra grocery store. Otherwise make as directed. Perfect for family meals when I have the time to cook, and my kids love it,"" says reviewer Blair Dunn. Allrecipes community member outdoorsgirl says, ""I love Thai food and do a lot of cooking. Kudos to Chef John for taking a Thai recipe and simplifying it so the average person can make a great dish! Substituting sweet soya instead of the regular soya and sugar works good too. The trick is a very hot wok ( hopefully) or skillet."" Editorial contributions by Vanessa Greaves Gather ingredients.

The crab legs should be fully cooked after about five or six minutes in the bubbling butter mixture. The whole recipe, sauce and all, only takes about 20 minutes to make. It's actually quite simple to eat Snow Crab legs — and you don't even need a special cracking tool. Just pull one of the legs off the cluster, bend at the joint, and pull the joints apart slowly. The meat should slide right out. Helpful hint: Make sure the legs are warm when you crack them, as it's more difficult to get cold crabmeat out of the shell. Store the cooked crab legs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for three to five days. When you're ready to enjoy them again, brush the crab legs with butter (bonus points if you have leftover garlic butter) and bake in a 350 degrees F oven for about eight minutes.

These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies have over 3,000 5-star reviews — and we're pretty sure you're about to add another one. These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are super easy to mix up in a stand mixer or with your hand mixer. Simply cream together your butter (make sure it's soft for easy beating) and sugars. Then add the rest of the wet ingredients, then the rest of the dry ingredients. Mix in the quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips by hand so they don't get crushed. Luckily for you, these are drop cookies, so you don't even have to worry about working with the dough. Simply drop spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets and bake them. We know, the oat selection in the grocery store can be quite overwhelming. There's just so many options to choose from. For oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, you should use either quick-cooking oats (like in this recipe) or old-fashioned oats. Old-fashioned oats will give you chewier cookies than quick-cooking oats, if that's what you prefer. Store baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks. Though they probably won't last that long because you'll want to eat them all straight out of the oven! You can freeze oatmeal chocolate chip cookies both baked and unbaked. To freeze baked cookies, store them in layers with a piece of parchment paper in between each layer in airtight containers or zip-top bags (make sure to squeeze out the excess air). Freeze for up to three months. To freeze cookie dough, place the dough balls on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer until solid. After the dough is hardened, transfer it to a zip-top bag (with the excess air squeezed out) and freeze for up to three months.

""These cookies are so good! Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. I had a lot of white chocolate chips so I mixed in white chocolate chips, then divided the dough and added butterscotch chips to half and chocolate chips to the other half,"" says HISTORYGIRL04.

Packed with oats, these are perfect for a grab-and-go breakfast, snack, or lunch box addition.",2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats; ⅓ cup packed brown sugar; 1 tablespoon white sugar; 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder; ½ teaspoon salt; ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon; 1 cup milk; 2 large eggs; 2 tablespoons canola oil; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract,"Are you looking for a chewy, flavorful breakfast treat that's perfect for on-the-go snacking? Then these baked breakfast bars are for you! They're so much better than store-bought and you customize them to your liking. Whip up a batch of these today, and then next week, and the week after that! Seriously, you won't be able to stop making them. Making homemade breakfast bars is so simple and it only takes 10 minutes of prep time (that's quicker than going to the store and buying a box of granola bars). You'll find the full detailed recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making these baked oatmeal bars. Combine oats, sugars, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, canola oil, and vanilla together. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients until combined. Let this mixture sit for about 20 minutes to allow flavors to meld together. Spoon the mixture into the pan and bake until the edges are golden brown. Allow to cool before cutting and serving. The best part about making granola bars at home is that you can add whatever you like. We suggest adding nuts, cranberries, raisins, berries, or chocolate chips. Baked oatmeal bars should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge. They will last for about five days. When you're ready to eat, you can serve them cold, at room temperature, or warm. If you aren't going to eat the bars within five days, or you just want to make a big batch when meal prepping, you can freeze baked oatmeal bars. Allow the bars to cool completely, then cut them into 16 bars — so you won't have to defrost the whole batch for one bar. Freeze the individual bars in zip-top freezer bags labeled with the date for up to three months. ""We really liked these. They froze well as individual bars for snacking on the go later. It is important to let the complete mixture soak before baking. This allows the oats to absorb the liquid and soften,"" says hertzen. ""Added additions of peanut butter powder, fine unsweetened coconut, and sliced almonds."" ""This is a great Base recipe! So many options. You are only limited by your imagination! I added almonds and dried cranberries... Making again in a few days I think dried cherries and walnuts..... This has a great texture as well,"" according to Stormy Hunt. ""Made exactly as directed.

240476,Turkey Tom Kha Gai,"One of the great blessings, and curses, of Thanksgiving is leftover turkey. That's where this spicy Thai coconut soup recipe comes in. This is my take on Tom Kha Gai, and as usual I make no claim as to its authenticity. I do know it tastes amazing and will make you forget you even roasted a turkey.

244323,Thanksgiving Turkey Congee,"My dad used to make huge Thanksgiving dinners, and the morning after, we would be treated to delicious turkey congee. Congee is a Chinese rice porridge traditionally eaten for breakfast or brunch, but I personally eat it any time. It is also very good for digestion and has excellent health benefits. Although I've been having congee since I was a baby, it remains for me the ultimate comfort food.","¼ cup dried scallops; 3  dried black mushrooms; 1 ½ cups uncooked short-grain white rice; ½  leftover turkey carcass, broken into pieces; 9 cups water; 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped; 1 bunch green onions, chopped; ¼ cup thinly sliced fresh ginger; ¼ cup raw peanuts; 2 tablespoons dried red onion; 8 dashes sesame oil; ground white pepper to taste","Place dried scallops and dried mushrooms in a bowl; pour in hot water to cover and let stand to rehydrate, about 10 minutes. Rinse and drain rice; set aside. Separate any meat from bones of turkey carcass; set aside. Place bones and 9 cups hot water in a large stockpot and bring to a boil. Drain mushrooms and scallops; squeeze out any excess water. Break scallops into smaller pieces; slice mushrooms thinly. Stir scallops, mushrooms, rice, and turkey meat into the stockpot; reduce heat to allow congee to simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally for a smooth congee, until rice is tender and congee is thick, about 2 hours. If you like a thinner congee, stir in hot water a few tablespoons at a time. Ladle congee into individual bowls; top each bowl with cilantro, green onions, ginger, peanuts, red onion, sesame oil, and white pepper as desired. Congee is both a very basic and very forgiving meal to make. There are many varieties, and after you have made it a few times, you will develop a preference for the water-to-rice ratio, add-ons, toppings, and seasonings. The ratio I put in this recipe makes a thicker congee, which I prefer, but you can always make it thinner. (It is easier to thin it out as you are cooking than the reverse!) Note that you can leave the bones in the pot while you ladle out the congee. If you have an Asian market near you, you can also buy fried doughnuts (also called fried crullers) to serve with the congee. Leftover congee will thicken, so when you reheat it the next day, you can stir in a tiny bit of water if desired. Look for the dried red onions mentioned in the Toppings in Asian markets or the International aisle of the supermarket.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/244323/thanksgiving-turkey-congee/

Skim off scum as it forms, but don't remove any fat. Cook until broth is rich and any turkey meat has been rendered flavorless, about 3 hours. While broth cooks, skim off fat as it rises to the surface and save it in a bowl. Save about 4 tablespoons turkey fat. After removing surface fat, strain broth into a bowl. Lightly whisk 2 eggs in a separate mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons cooled rendered turkey fat and whisk to mix. Whisk in salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix in seltzer water.

Bring a pot of salted cold water to a boil. Gently place matzo balls into the boiling water. Reduce heat so they simmer gently; cover the pot. Simmer until matzo balls are cooked through, about 30 minutes, adjusting heat as they cook so a gentle simmer continues. Transfer to hot serving bowls, 2 per serving. Stir freshly chopped parsley and dill into soup. Ladle hot soup over the matzo balls. My turkey was already very well seasoned, so I didn't need to add much to the stockpot.

Like many other chefs my age, I heard about ""fricasseeing"" years before even thinking about going to culinary school. It wasn't Julia Child, or the Galloping Gourmet, but rather a much more important cultural, and social phenomenon, Looney Tunes. That's right; Bugs Bunny turned me on to fricassee. In that fateful episode, it was a rabbit fricassee being discussed, and whether or not a special hunting permit was necessary to ""harvest"" the meat for this delicious stew recipe. I won't say anymore, so as not to spoil the ending, just in case you're just now getting in to very old cartoons, but that's how and when this fun to say, and even more fun to eat, word entered by brain. ""Fricassee"" is a generic culinary term that refers to meat stewed in a pan, usually with wine, after being very well browned first. It's a perfect way to cook rabbit, or a tough old chicken, and can be adapted a hundred different ways. I love this version, but I invite you to play around with any and all of the ingredients. Just make sure you have the right hunting permit if you're not going to get your chicken, or rabbit, from the store. Enjoy! Season chicken thighs with salt on both sides. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and place chicken skin-side-down into the hot oil. Cook until there is a good sear and fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until seared as well, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Leave 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat in the pan and add sliced mushrooms. Cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Add onion, shallots, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with pepper and cayenne and stir in flour to thicken the mixture, about 1 minute. Pour in white wine and cook, stirring, until alcohol has evaporated. Raise the heat to high and keep cooking until sauce has reduced to half, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, thyme, and bay leaf and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-lo and add chicken and any accumulated juices back into the skillet, skin side up. Cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes, turning over thighs halfway through. Remove lid and turn thighs back to skin side up. Continue to simmer uncovered, basting occasionally, until chicken is tender and sauce reduces even more. If the pan gets dry before the chicken is tender, add some more water or broth. Add cream and simmer until sauce reaches desired thickness. Heat can be raised to medium to reduce cream faster if chicken is already tender. Sauce can be served thin and runny, or reduced to a thick sauce. Sprinkle with fresh thyme and serve.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8506346/chef-johns-chicken-fricassee/

Just place the handle of your wooden spoon (or a wooden chopstick) into the oil. If a steady stream of bubbles emerges from the wood, the oil is perfect.

Give it 12 minutes and get a mouthwatering, taste bud-tingling treat.",1 large russet potato; salt and ground black pepper to taste; 1 tablespoon butter; 2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese; 1 tablespoon sour cream,"When you're short on time or patience, waiting an hour or more for an oven-baked potato might seem like a tall order. That's why this recipe is so darn good – you can have a perfectly microwaved baked potato in just a little more than 10 minutes! It sounds too good to be true but, we promise, this recipe is just as good as reviewers say it is. It couldn't be easier to microwave baked potatoes. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: Scrub your potato under running water, prick it with a fork, then place it on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave for about 5 minutes, flip it over, and microwave it for about 5 more minutes. Let the potato cool for just a few minutes, until it's safe to handle. Cut the potato lengthwise so that it opens and forms a natural bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then mash the inside with a fork. Top with butter and Cheddar, then return to the microwave to melt the cheese. Finish it with sour cream and the toppings of your choice. We find that this 10-minute method works well to create a perfectly tender baked potato – 5 minutes on one side, 5 minutes on the other. However, not all microwaves cook at exactly the same power. If you've found in the past that your microwave is more or less powerful than other microwaves, you may want to adjust the recipe by a few minutes. This microwave baked potato recipe calls for a russet potato, and we think that's the best way to go. Russets have thick skin that crisps up nicely in the microwave or in the oven. Plus, they have super starchy insides that'll ensure a perfectly fluffy filling. Technically, though, you can use any starchy potato you have on hand. Classic baked potato toppings include sour cream, Cheddar, crumbled bacon, and fresh chives. You can get as creative as you want, though! Try chili and shredded cheese for a fun take on a classic comfort food, cooked pulled pork and barbecue sauce to satisfy a barbecue craving, or pico de gallo and black beans for a Mexican-inspired option. You can eat these microwave baked potatoes as a meal by themselves. Just dress it up with toppings and you're good to go (throw in a Caesar salad or roasted veggies to add a little color to your plate). However, many people like to serve baked potatoes as a side dish, paired with hearty meat-based entrees.

I've been looking for a good microwave baked potato recipe (I'm too lazy to oven bake them). This is very good. I've never tried a baked potato with cheese on it...I've been missing out.

57783,Homemade Crispy Hash Browns,"Good, old-fashioned, restaurant-style hash browns. Perfect with hot pepper sauce and ketchup!","2 medium russet potatoes, shredded; ½ medium onion, finely chopped; ¼ cup all-purpose flour; 1 large egg; 1 cup oil for frying, or as needed; salt and pepper to taste","If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes. Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish. Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy). Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture. Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side. To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping. You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly. If you care about the crisp, then you should use starchy potatoes, like russets or Idahoes. The only drawback is that the hash browns may be prone to falling apart because of the starchiness. So, if you want your hash brown to stick together easily, then you should use a waxy potato, like new potatoes, Yukon Golds, or red potatoes. These potatoes have more moisture and will stick together in the pan, however, they won't crisp up as nicely as starchy potatoes. The biggest culprit that's making your hash browns come apart is moisture. You need to make sure the potatoes are dry before adding them to the flour and egg mixture. Whether you squeeze them out in a dish towel or use a salad spinner, get the potatoes as dry as they can be. You can also use a different type of potato if you are worried about the hash browns breaking apart. If you use a waxy potato, they'll stick together nicely, but they won't get as crispy as you might want. Another option is to add more ingredients that will act as binders. Try adding cheese to your hash browns because when the cheese melts it will be like a gooey glue that holds your potatoes together. ""These turned out great! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hash browns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices,"" says eiskyjente. ""Unbelievable. About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside. And what a flavor. This will be my hash brown recipe from here on out. Make sure that you don't have too much oil in the pan. The hash browns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste,"" advises Curt McLey. ""My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp Cheddar, a little garlic powder, a dash of oregano, and some green onions. I will keep this recipe and use it over and over. Always trying a little something different,"" raves MR BANANA. Editorial contributions by Bailey Fink. Gather all ingredients. Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed. Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes. Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping. Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Serve hot and enjoy!",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/57783/emilys-famous-hash-browns/
74360,Best Meatloaf,"This is the best meatloaf recipe ever and comes complete with a yummy glaze. It will knock your socks off! My mom never made meatloaf when I was growing up so when I moved out on my own, I started experimenting with different recipes and this is my best creation.","1 tablespoon butter; ¼ cup minced onion; 2 cloves garlic, minced; 1 ½ teaspoons salt; 1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper; 2 pounds extra-lean ground beef; 3 slices bread, toasted and crumbled; 7  buttery round crackers, crushed; 1  egg, lightly beaten; 3 ½ tablespoons sour cream; 1 ½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce; 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided; ¼ cup milk, or as needed (Optional); 3 tablespoons ketchup","Good old-fashioned meatloaf stands alongside hot dogs and apple pie as iconic American foods. That's not to say any of those dishes actually originated in America, but that hasn't stopped us from embedding them deeply into our culture and lore, and making them our own. Meatloaf especially is a product of ingenuity and making-do as thrifty, waste-not home cooks combine low-cost ingredients to make a satisfying main dish that will stretch ingredients and feed a family. Yet, as a highly customizable recipe, meatloaf can be found everywhere from classic diners to high-end restaurants, to everyday dinner tables. Meatloaf recipes are typically made of ground meats mixed with vegetables, seasonings, and crushed crackers or fine breadcrumbs, and are held together with a binder; usually an egg or two. This top-rated recipe for Best Meatloaf demonstrates how to make a meatloaf using the most simple ingredients and tried-and-tested techniques: Meat mixtureThis recipe for Best Meatloaf uses extra-lean ground beef, which means the fat-to-meat ratio is about 4 percent fat to 96 percent lean. The low ratio of fat results in a meatloaf with minimal grease. But since fat carries flavor, you'll want to add some back to keep blandness at bay. By adding a touch of sour cream to the mixture, this recipe benefits from that little extra fat plus a hint of tangy flavor at the same time. Note: adding milk is optional and may only be necessary if you're cooking at higher altitudes. Sautéed vegetablesCooking minced aromatics (a fancy term for the onion and garlic) in butter before adding it to the meat mixture mellows the flavors and ensures you won't bite into the sharp taste of onion and garlic. Flavor boostersThere's nothing shy about the taste of Worcestershire sauce, and adding it to the mix along with tomato sauce brings sweet and savory flavor to every bite. A top glaze of tomato sauce and ketchup creates a delectable sauce to finish the dish. Baking techniqueHow long to cook meatloaf depends on the size of the loaf and the temperature of the oven. Ideally, you want to fully cook the inside to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). This recipe for Best Meatloaf gives you a clever 3-step approach: You'll bake the meatloaf for 40 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to fully cook the inside, and then increase the heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes to give the outside a tasty crust. Finally, you'll brush the meatloaf with tomato sauce and ketchup, and bake it for 10 more minutes to caramelize the glaze. Don't overwork the mixCombine the ingredients until they just come together, otherwise you'll end up with a dense, compacted meatloaf. Think smallI'm talking about the size of the solid add-ins. Cut the onions and garlic (or any other vegetables you might add) into very small, uniform pieces before sautéeing them. Crush the crackers and crumble the breadcrumbs until they're very fine. This helps make a more uniform meatloaf texture. Let it rest before slicingJust like with any roasted meat, meatloaf needs to sit for a bit (about 10 minutes) so it can reabsorb the juices before you slice and serve. Read more: 5 Secrets for Making Better Meatloaf Home cook Brandi' Smith raves, ""This was the first meatloaf I have ever made and the only real change I made was to use Italian breadcrumbs and a dash of Italian seasoning, and it was phenomenal! I didn't have a meat thermometer, but the timing was perfect! My husband took one bite and said it tasted like his mom's! I think next time I will use half ground sirloin and half ground pork as another suggested..."" ""I made this tonight for my family and it was a great meatloaf! The only thing I changed on this recipe was I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Anyway...this turkey meatloaf was absolutely fantastic! Oh yeah...one other thing I did was use a cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the sliced bread. My whole family said this was 'the best meatloaf I have ever made.'"" —JoJo Mandy says, ""My husband and I (who are NOT big meatloaf fans) loved the heck out of this recipe.

216888,Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo,"I am going to give you my Creole gumbo recipe. I learned to cook from my mother and grandmother who were born and raised in New Orleans and really knew how to cook. Most of the time, you could not get them to write down their recipes because they used a ""pinch"" of this and ""just enough of that"" and so on. This recipe is a combination of both of their recipes which I have added to over the years. Serve over hot cooked rice.","1 cup all-purpose flour; ¾ cup bacon drippings; 1 cup coarsely chopped celery; 1 large onion, coarsely chopped; 1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped; 2 cloves garlic, minced; 1 pound andouille sausage, sliced; 3 quarts water; 6 cubes beef bouillon; 1 tablespoon white sugar; salt to taste; 2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco), or to taste; ½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's), or to taste; 4  bay leaves; ½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves; 1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes; 1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce; 4 teaspoons file powder, divided; 2 tablespoons bacon drippings; 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed; 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar; 1 pound lump crabmeat; 3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined; 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce","New Orleans-style gumbo is a true taste of Southern tradition. This boldly flavored stew is bursting with fresh, filling ingredients like bell pepper, sausage, stewed tomatoes, and crabmeat. Hot sauce ad Cajun seasonings add a kick that makes this Lousiana dish a favorite amongst our community of home cooks. Learn how to make the best homestyle gumbo right here. Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens. As varied as the recipes can be, there are a few ingredients that all gumbos have in common: homemade stock; the ""holy trinity"" of celery, onions, and green peppers; and roux. Boldly delicious New Orleans-style gumbo is surprisingly easy to make at home. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe: Great gumbo starts with roux, a flavorful thickening agent made from equal parts fat and flour. Once the roux is a deep golden color, add diced veggies and sausage to the mix. Then, incorporate beef bouillon, hot sauce, tomatoes, and seasonings to intensify the flavor. Let the gumbo simmer for 45 minutes before adding file powder, okra, and seafood. The result will be a lusciously hearty stew packed with Creole spice. Gumbo file, or file powder, is made from dried sassafras leaves. This ingredient was first used by Choctaw Indians and was later adopted by Acadians (Cajuns) when they arrived in the American South. Gumbo file has a deep, earthy flavor similar to thyme and should be added to gumbo in the last minutes of cooking — it helps to thicken and enrich the stew for an authentic taste of New Orleans. Leftover gumbo can be stored safely in the refrigerator for three to four days. Let the dish come to room temperature before placing it in an airtight container to enjoy later. Gently reheat on the stovetop for best results. ""This is one of the best gumbos I've ever had and my family is from the South so that is saying a lot — just don't tell my mother or grandmother,"" shares reviewer mellie18_99. ""I added shrimp, sausage, chicken, and crab meat."" ""This recipe is the real deal,"" raves home cook Pat. ""Don't forget the file gumbo at the very end, it makes a big difference. You will know when the roux is done when it has the color of a Hershey's milk chocolate bar."" ""This was my very first time making gumbo and my guests who had come over for a King Party loved it!"" says Shaw Kitty. ""Some of these guests were born and raised Louisianans and they gave their approval as well!"" Editorial contributions by Rai Mincey and Vanessa Greaves Gather all ingredients. Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking. Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into roux, and mix in sliced sausage. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water. Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce.

If you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.· Noodles: Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy.· Carrots: Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they stay crisp.

This simple ground beef stroganoff comes together in 20 minutes with just six ingredients. Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce.

261839,Baked Chicken Thighs Coated With Corn Flake Crumbs,"I like these cornflake chicken thighs so much that I make them often. The Sriracha scarcely adds any heat at all (mainly flavor), so don't worry about spiciness. For overall crispiness, I usually bake the thighs on a baking rack that's been placed over a foil-lined half-sheet pan. Don't omit the sugar, as it helps the coating adhere to the chicken. By the way, cornflake crumbs are usually sold in supermarkets near the bread crumbs and coating mixes, not in the cereal aisle.","8  chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat and skin; 1 ½ cups corn flake crumbs; 1 tablespoon teriyaki sauce; 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce; 1 tablespoon sweet paprika; 2 teaspoons rice vinegar; 2 teaspoons white sugar","Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a half-sheet pan with aluminum foil. Place a baking rack on top. Place corn flake crumbs in a bowl. Mix teriyaki sauce, Sriracha sauce, paprika, rice vinegar, and sugar together in a large bowl until sauce has a thick consistency. Place chicken thighs in the bowl with sauce. Tumble thighs together until completely coated. Smear sauce onto any bare spots and under any loose flaps of skin. Place 1 thigh into the bowl with corn flakes. Spoon crumbs on top using a tablespoon. Press crumbs onto thigh using the back of the spoon, pressing thigh down into crumbs to coat underside. Turn over and repeat pressing. Place onto the baking rack, skin-side up. Repeat with remaining thighs and crumbs, placing largest thighs in the corners of the rack to receive the most heat. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes depending on the size of thighs. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue baking, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn thighs over to help undersides crisp up. Bake until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let thighs rest on the baking rack for at least 15 minutes before serving. The sauce is not a marinade, so don't let the thighs sit in it for very long, or else its salty ingredients will extract moisture that you want to remain in the thighs. Also, watery sauce won't hold the corn flake crumbs onto the thighs. Small thighs may take only 55 minutes, but very large thighs may take an hour and a quarter. Refrigerate any leftovers only after they've cooled significantly (to minimize condensation of steam). Place a double layer of paper towels under them. Simpler method: Line your pan with aluminum foil. Don't use a baking rack. Coat only the skin side of the thighs with corn flake crumbs. Bake them skin side up, without turning them over. Chicken finger variation: Use chicken breast cutlets sliced into 1-inch-wide fingers. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes.",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261839/baked-chicken-thighs-coated-with-corn-flake-crumbs/
